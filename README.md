# NASABot

Our problem: The issue with our NASA data is that often it can be challenging to access for many coupled with mountains of data that can be time consuming to comb through. 

Our objectives: Our web application called NASABot is designed to make accessing data quick and easy especially as well as convenient with simple prompts and selections. A good example is 


This program is designed to work very similar to an internet search engine.

Note that the red, yellow, and green buttons on the top left of the window do not work


Selecting "Astronomy Picture of the Day" in the drop down menu and selecting submit will give you the current day's selected picture from the NASA API. The image will be provided with the date as well as a description of the image contents to give the viewer some background context and some information on how the image was taken. 


When selecting "Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC)" in the drop down menu and pressing submit, you get a second promp asking for a date. You can either type or select a date from the calender and once you press search, you get a full list of photos from the EPIC from that particular date. EPIC provides full colour high definition photos of the earth's day side from langrange 1 orbit.

Submitting the "earth based imagery" option will give you a promp for entering the latitude, longitude, dimension, and date. Enter the respective information and you will obtain top down imagery of the location specified by the latitude and longitude coordinates on that date. This application can be very useful for individuals looking to find land use or geography data over time such as the shifting landscape or to monitor progress on a construction site.

The "Mars rover Photos option" will give you a prompt that will require the sol or day on mars and a selection of camera option. Sol represents martian days that the cuorisity rover has been on mars and a number can be entered to select the exact day that the photos are taken. The select camera allows the user to find the image based on the camera used on the cuorisity rover to take the image. Note that on some sols, the selected camera is not used which will not provide an image for the promp. As a result, the prompt will only provide a blank display.

FInally when selecting the "Exoplant Archive", you obtain a 


Conclusion: In summary, our web application is designed to make NASA data and imagery easily accessible to the masses with a user friendly prompt
