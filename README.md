Selecting "Astronomy Picture of the Day" in the top bar and selecting submit will give you the current day's selected picture from the NASA API.

When selecting "Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC)" in the drop down menu and pressing submit, you get a second promp asking for a date. You can either type or select a date from the calender and once you press search, you get a full list of photos from the EPIC from that particular date.
